# yeller-timbre-appender

A Clojure library that integrates [yellerapp.com](http://yellerapp.com) with the Timbre logging library.

## Installation

Leiningen:
```
[yeller-timbre-appender "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

## Usage

#### Setup

First initialize the Yeller timbre appender:

```clojure
(require '[yeller-timbre-appender :reload true])
(timbre/set-config! [:appenders :yeller]
  (yeller-timbre-appender/make-yeller-appender
  {:token "YOUR TOKEN HERE" :environment "production"}))
```

Note that Yeller doesn't record errors sent from the `test` or `development`
environments.

The record an exception using timbre's usual logging mechanisms:

```clojure
;; recording an exception runs via timbre as usual
(require '[taoensso.timbre :as timbre])
(timbre/error (ex-info "woops" {:some :useful-data}))
```

The Yeller appender records errors sent at the `error` and `fatal` levels. If
you have an `ex-info` style error, it extracts the data given and sends it to
Yeller.

To attach extra information, like the url and so on, you can pass a map as the second argument to timbre's `error` call:

```clojure
(require '[taoensso.timbre :as timbre])
(timbre/error (ex-info "woops" {:some :useful-data}) {:custom-data {:params {:user-id 1}} :url "http://example.com"})
```

For example, to use the timbre error in a ring middleware:

```clojure
(require '[taoensso.timbre :as timbre])

(defn wrap-error-handling [handler]
  (fn [req]
    (try
      (handler req)
      (catch Throwable t
        (timbre/error t {:url (:uri req)})))))
```

The map argument takes the same set of keys the yeller clojure client takes as its second argument. See the docstring on `yeller-clojure-client/report`:

```clojure
(doc yeller-clojure-client/report)
```
